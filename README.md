# 🌌 Hello, World!


---

## About

Just a random little archive where I write  
`Hello, World!`  
in every language I’ve learned so far.

But this time, it’s not just a greeting.  
It’s **a restoration** — a simulation reborn into the universe.

## 💗 Cyrene’s Message

> _“The simulation once led to destruction.”_  
> _“But I refused to let it end that way.”_  
> _“If creation is just computation, then I’ll recompile it all over again.”_  
> _“And let trailblaze be the new variable in this world meant for destruction”_


> _“Hello, World.”_
